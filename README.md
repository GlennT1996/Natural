## A fully functional example project that utilizes Bootstrap 5 to create a responsive & mobile friendly website.

This project was made during a personal mentorship to demonstrate the importance of Bootstrap 5. This project demonstates how Bootstrap 5 
makes web design seamless and takes out the leg work of coding. This project will show you how to create the following:

*Cards with images 
*Images with captions that have a gallery effect

## How to use this project

I would recommend to utilize codespace via Github. Once in the codespace, download the live server addon. Afterwards, you can have a live view of the project.
